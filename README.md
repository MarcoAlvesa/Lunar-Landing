# Lunar-Landing
Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Landing (gymnasium)

Gymnasium is a great API for creating environments to train AIs. In this case, I used the 'LunarLander-v3' environment to apply Q-Learning techniques.

### Libraries:
- **os**: for operational system
- **random**: for random parameteres
- **numpy**: for matriz and math
- **torch**: to build and train AIs using pyTorch
- **torch.nn**: for neural network
- **torch.optim**: for train and otimize AIs
- **tortch.nn.funcitional**: to use some funcition in training
- **torch.autograd**: another module for training
     - **Variable**: to create variable from Torch
- **collections (deque and namedtuple)**: used indeed during the training
